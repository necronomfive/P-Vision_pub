# Welcome to P-Vision!

**AmiGUS** is a modern high quality sound card for the Amiga. It was designed to provide the right combination of accelerated hardware and software features to bring the full multimedia experience to all Amiga users. 

By supporting established frameworks such as **AHI** and **MHI**, we ensure that the card is compatible to a wide range of already existing applications. In addition, the card's true power lies in its highly sophisticated wavetable engine, which provides a powerful feature upgrade to PAULA, supporting 32 true hardware voices using 32 MB of sample memory.

The good news is that, in order to use these features, you don't need a fast CPU. **AmiGUS** can be used on **ALL** Amigas with a free Zorro Slot, since all of the computational heavy-lifting is performed by the hardware acclerated functions on the card.

And since we are at it right now, you can own an **AmiGUS** too, either by buying it from one of our **supported resellers**, or you just download the card's design files provided here and **build one on your own!**

## How to Build your AmiGUS
Here you find all materials to build your own personal AmiGUS card. Most soldering parts have been chosen so that you can build the card, even if you have novice soldering skills. If you are unsure, we recommend to either contact a person who is trustworthy and has the required soldering skills, or buy the card from one of our resellers.

In terms of PCB manufacturing, both PCBWAY and JLPCB were able to produce functional boards during our prototyping phase. 
It is recommended that you specify either chamfering or beveling for the slot edge connector in order to prevent mechanical damage to the Zorro slots.
